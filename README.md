Diabetes is a prevalent chronic ailment in the United States, impacting millions and posing a substantial economic burden. This project addresses the challenge of predicting diabetes onset using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, comprising 70,692 observations with 21 features. The primary focus is to employ logistic regression and random forest models to determine the most accurate predictor of diabetes presence.

The project utilizes logistic regression and random forest models. Logistic regression is chosen for its simplicity, interpretability, and probabilistic output. In contrast, random forest is selected for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and aggregate predictions from multiple trees.

The dataset encompasses various health indicators such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, BMI, smoking history, stroke, heart disease, physical activity, dietary habits, alcohol consumption, healthcare coverage, and general health assessment. The response variable is binary, indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes.
